# DFM Web

This dummy folder is where a kitchen sink of html structures live.
 
Start the dev server and see examples of everything.

Note: I decided to keep the tablesorter CSS even though it's not required
in the gem anymore.  It's pretty universal though, so I made it a development
dependency and kept the examples.
